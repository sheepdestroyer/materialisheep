Now `eagerLoad()` only checks `isEagerLoad()` and always calls `load()`, so multiple invocations (e.g., repeated `loadNow()` or visibility changes) can trigger repeated loads. Please reintroduce the `!isLoaded()` check:\n\n```java\nfinal void eagerLoad() {\n    if (mViewModel.isEagerLoad() && !mViewModel.isLoaded()) {\n        mViewModel.setLoaded(true);\n        load();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nand ensure `STATE_LOADED` is restored from the ViewModel if that flag must be persisted.\n</issue_to_address>\n\n### Comment 2\n<location> `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/LazyLoadFragment.java:39-48` </location>\n<code_context>\n      */\n-    @SuppressWarnings(\"deprecation\") // Using deprecated onActivityCreated; migration to onViewCreated requires\n-                                     // refactoring\n-    @Override\n-    public void onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n-        super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);\n</code_context>\n\n<issue_to_address>\n**suggestion:** Using `setUserVisibleHint` is deprecated and won\u2019t be triggered by ViewPager2.\n\nWith ViewPager2 + FragmentStateAdapter, `setUserVisibleHint` is never invoked because visibility is controlled via `setMaxLifecycle`, so this method is effectively dead code and can mislead future maintenance around lazy loading.\n\nGiven that `loadNow()` is already triggered from the ViewPager2 `OnPageChangeCallback`, you can remove this override. If you still need lifecycle-driven loading, tie it to fragment lifecycle callbacks (e.g., `onResume` with the adapter\u2019s current item) instead of `setUserVisibleHint`.\n</issue_to_address>\n~~~\n\n</details>\n\n***\n\n<details>\n<summary>Sourcery is free for open source - if you like our reviews please consider sharing them \u2728</summary>\n\n- [X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/share?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://sourcery.ai)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://sourcery.ai)\n\n</details>\n\n<sub>\nHelp me be more useful!

The comment is technically correct - setUserVisibleHint is deprecated. However, I need to consider the rules: the PR is migrating from setRetainInstance to ViewModel, which is already a significant refactoring. The author may have intentionally kept setUserVisibleHint for now as part of a gradual migration. The comment suggests alternatives but doesn't provide specific actionable code. It's more of a \"you should consider\" type comment rather than pointing out a clear bug. Given the context that this is already a migration PR, the author likely knows about this deprecation and may be addressing it incrementally. The author is already doing a significant refactoring to migrate to ViewModel. They may be aware of the deprecation and intentionally keeping this for now. The comment doesn't show that this causes a concrete problem, just that it's deprecated. Without knowing if there's a specific issue this causes, this might be premature optimization feedback. While the author may be aware of the deprecation, adding deprecated APIs in new code is generally a code smell. However, the comment is somewhat speculative (\"consider using\") rather than pointing to a definite issue. The rules state not to make speculative comments and to only comment if there's clearly a code change required. This comment points out a deprecated API but is more of a suggestion than identifying a clear bug or required change. Given the rules against speculative comments and the fact that this is already a refactoring PR, this comment should be deleted as it's not pointing to a definite issue that must be fixed.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>2. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/BaseListActivity.java:578</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> Unbind logic removes fragments using hardcoded tags 'f0' and 'f1'; ensure these tags remain valid if the page count ever changes.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Comment did not seem useful.

While technically correct, I need to consider if this is \"obvious or unimportant\" according to the rules. The typo is minor - \"in to\" vs \"into\" - and doesn't affect code functionality. However, looking more closely at the diff, this JavaDoc comment appears to be copied from Android's standard documentation for onViewCreated. The text \"restored in to the view\" is actually the original Android documentation text. If this is copied from the Android SDK documentation, then the author likely copied it verbatim and changing it might not be appropriate. But I can't be 100% sure without checking the Android source. The comment is very minor and could be considered \"obvious or unimportant\" - it's just a small grammatical issue in a comment that doesn't affect functionality. This could be standard Android documentation that was copied verbatim, in which case changing it might not be appropriate. Also, even if it's a legitimate typo, it's extremely minor and could fall under \"obvious or unimportant\" comments that should not be made. While it might be standard documentation, I cannot verify that without additional context. However, the rule about \"obvious or unimportant\" comments is clear - this is a very minor grammatical issue in documentation that has no impact on code functionality. Such minor typo corrections typically fall into the category of unimportant comments. This comment should be deleted. It's pointing out a very minor grammatical typo in documentation that has no functional impact. This falls under the rule against \"obvious or unimportant\" comments. Additionally, the JavaDoc may be copied from Android's standard documentation, making the change potentially inappropriate.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>7. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/LazyLoadFragment.java:67</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> Typographical suggestion: On line 67, consider replacing \"in to\" with \"into\" for better readability.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 20% vs. threshold = 50% This is a comment about a typo in documentation/comments. Looking at the rules, I need to check: 1) Is this about a code change? Yes, the javadoc comment was added in this diff. 2) Does it require a code change? It's suggesting a typo fix, which is very minor. 3) Is it obvious or unimportant? This is a very minor typo fix in a comment. The rules say \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant.\" A typo in documentation is quite minor and could be considered unimportant. 4) The rules emphasize not making comments unless there is \"clearly a code change required\" - a typo in a comment is not really a code change that affects functionality. This seems like the kind of nitpicky comment that should be filtered out. While fixing typos improves code quality, this is an extremely minor issue in a comment that doesn't affect functionality. The rules specifically say not to make obvious or unimportant comments, and a two-word typo in documentation could fall into that category. You're right that this is very minor. The rules emphasize not making comments unless there's clearly a code change required, and fixing \"in to\" vs \"into\" in a javadoc comment is not a critical code change. This is the type of nitpicky, unimportant comment that should be filtered out. This comment should be deleted. While it correctly identifies a typo, it's an unimportant and obvious issue in documentation that doesn't warrant a review comment according to the rules.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>8. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/ListFragment.java:185</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> Typo in the documentation comment: consider using \"into\" instead of \"in to\" in the phrase \"restored in to the view.\"\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 20% vs. threshold = 50% This is a documentation typo fix suggestion. The rules state \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant.\" A typo in documentation could be considered minor/unimportant. However, the rules also say \"Comments that suggest code quality refactors are good! But only if they are actionable and clear.\" This is actionable and clear - it's a simple typo fix. The question is whether fixing a documentation typo counts as important enough. The phrase \"in to\" vs \"into\" is indeed incorrect grammar - \"into\" is the correct preposition here. However, this is a very minor issue in a comment that was just added. The rules emphasize not commenting unless there's \"clearly a code change required\" and to avoid \"obvious or unimportant\" comments. A documentation typo, while technically incorrect, is quite minor and doesn't affect functionality. This seems to fall into the \"unimportant\" category. While the typo is real and the fix is correct, documentation typos are generally considered minor issues. The comment doesn't affect code functionality, and the meaning is still clear despite the grammatical error. This might be too pedantic for a code review. Even though it's minor, documentation quality matters for maintainability. However, the rules explicitly state not to make \"obvious or unimportant\" comments, and a small grammatical error in documentation that doesn't affect understanding likely falls into this category. The bar for keeping comments should be high. This comment points out a legitimate typo, but it's a very minor documentation issue that doesn't affect code functionality or clarity. Given the rules emphasize avoiding unimportant comments, this should be deleted.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> \n> Workflow ID: <workflowid>`wflow_aWmqFbXzZ6ycdrMk`</workflowid>\n> </details>\n> \n> <sup>You can customize </sup>[<img alt=\"Ellipsis\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Ellipsis-blue?color=175173\">](https://www.ellipsis.dev?ref=sheepdestroyer%2Fmaterialisheep&utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral)<sup> by changing your [verbosity settings](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/settings/code-review), reacting with :+1: or :-1:, [replying to comments](https://docs.ellipsis.dev/features/code-review#teaching-ellipsis), or adding [code review rules](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/code-review/rules).</sup>",

    "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis pull request is a significant and well-executed refactoring to modernize the app's architecture. The migration from the deprecated `ViewPager` and `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` to `ViewPager2` and `FragmentStateAdapter` is a great improvement. I also appreciate the modernization of Fragment APIs, such as replacing `onActivityCreated` with `onViewCreated`, using `MenuProvider` for menus, and adopting `ViewModel` for state retention instead of `setRetainInstance`. The code is cleaner and follows current Android best practices. I've left a few minor suggestions to further improve code quality and maintainability, but overall this is excellent work.",

Now we only check `mViewModel.isEagerLoad()`, always set `setLoaded(true)`, and never read the loaded state, so repeated `eagerLoad()` calls (e.g. via `loadNow()` or visibility changes) will re-invoke `load()`. Unless `load()` is guaranteed idempotent, this is a behavioral regression. Please reintroduce a loaded guard using the ViewModel state, e.g. `if (mViewModel.isEagerLoad() && !mViewModel.isLoaded()) { mViewModel.setLoaded(true); load(); }`.\n</issue_to_address>\n\n### Comment 2\n<location> `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/LazyLoadFragment.java:39-48` </location>\n<code_context>\n      */\n-    @SuppressWarnings(\"deprecation\") // Using deprecated onActivityCreated; migration to onViewCreated requires\n-                                     // refactoring\n-    @Override\n-    public void onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n-        super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);\n</code_context>\n\n<issue_to_address>\n**issue (bug_risk):** Using setUserVisibleHint() with ViewPager2 is deprecated and likely ineffective.\n\nThis means the lazy-load check (`if (isVisibleToUser && !mViewModel.isLoaded())`) may never run as intended. Instead, trigger lazy loading from lifecycle callbacks (`onStart`/`onResume`) or from ViewPager2\u2019s page change callbacks (similar to how `loadNow()` is used in Activities), and drive any per-page visibility handling from those callbacks rather than `setUserVisibleHint()`.\n</issue_to_address>\n\n### Comment 3\n<location> `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/BaseListActivity.java:531-540` </location>\n<code_context>\n+        mViewPager.setAdapter(mAdapter);\n</code_context>\n\n<issue_to_address>\n**issue (bug_risk):** TabLayoutMediator and callbacks are never detached, which can leak and cause duplicate callbacks on rebind.\n\n`bindViewPager()` now creates a `TabLayoutMediator`, a `ViewPager2.OnPageChangeCallback`, and a `TabLayout.OnTabSelectedListener`, but `unbindViewPager()` only removes fragments. If `bindViewPager()` is invoked multiple times, you\u2019ll accumulate mediators and callbacks, leading to leaks and duplicate events. Store these as fields and clean them up in `unbindViewPager()` (e.g. `mediator.detach()`, `mViewPager.unregisterOnPageChangeCallback(...)`, `mTabLayout.removeOnTabSelectedListener(...)`).\n</issue_to_address>\n\n### Comment 4\n<location> `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/ItemActivity.java:186-187` </location>\n<code_context>\n         mSystemUiHelper = new AppUtils.SystemUiHelper(getWindow());\n         mReplyButton = findViewById(R.id.reply_button);\n         mNavButton = findViewById(R.id.navigation_button);\n+        mNavButton = findViewById(R.id.navigation_button);\n         mNavButton.setNavigable(direction ->\n</code_context>\n\n<issue_to_address>\n**nitpick:** mNavButton is assigned twice in a row; the first assignment appears redundant.\n\nIn `onCreate`, `mNavButton` is assigned twice with `findViewById(R.id.navigation_button)` in consecutive lines; the second is redundant and should be removed, or the ID corrected if a different view was intended.\n</issue_to_address>\n~~~\n\n</details>\n\n***\n\n<details>\n<summary>Sourcery is free for open source - if you like our reviews please consider sharing them \u2728</summary>\n\n- [X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/share?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://sourcery.ai)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://sourcery.ai)\n\n</details>\n\n<sub>\nHelp me be more useful!

    "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis pull request is a great step forward in modernizing the app's architecture by migrating from the deprecated `ViewPager` and `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` to `ViewPager2` and `FragmentStateAdapter`. The changes also correctly replace other deprecated APIs like `onActivityCreated`, `setRetainInstance`, and fragment menu methods with their modern counterparts (`onViewCreated`, `ViewModel`, and `MenuProvider`).\n\nThe implementation is solid overall, but I've identified a few issues:\n- A duplicated line of code in `ItemActivity`.\n- A potential bug in `LazyLoadFragment` that could cause data to be loaded multiple times.\n- Some redundant code in `LazyLoadFragment` due to API changes in `ViewPager2`.\n\nI've left specific comments with suggestions to address these points. Once these are fixed, this will be a very strong contribution to the codebase's health.",

However, the comment is phrased as \"Consider migrating... in future revisions\" which makes it sound like a suggestion for future work rather than something that needs to be fixed now. According to the rules, comments should be about clear code changes required, not speculative or informational. The phrase \"in future revisions\" suggests this is not urgent or required for this PR. Additionally, if setUserVisibleHint is deprecated, that would likely be caught by the build system with a deprecation warning, which falls under \"anything that would be obviously caught by the build.\" The author might be intentionally using setUserVisibleHint because they're maintaining compatibility with older Android versions or because a full migration to the newer approach would require more extensive refactoring. The comment could be useful as a reminder for future work, even if it's not actionable now. While the comment might be useful as a future reminder, the rules explicitly state not to make comments unless there is clearly a code change required. The phrase \"in future revisions\" indicates this is not a required change for this PR. Additionally, deprecation warnings would be caught by the build system, so this falls under things that would be \"obviously caught by the build.\" This comment should be deleted because it's phrased as a suggestion for future work (\"in future revisions\") rather than a required change for this PR.

However, I need to check the rules carefully. The rules state \"Do NOT comment unless there is clearly a code change required\" and \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant.\" A typo in a javadoc comment is relatively minor and could be considered unimportant. However, looking at the diff more carefully, I notice that this javadoc text appears to be copied from Android's standard documentation (it's describing onViewCreated). The text \"in to\" might actually be from the original Android documentation that was copied. But wait - this is still just a documentation typo, not a functional code issue. The rules emphasize not making obvious or unimportant comments, and a minor typo in documentation could fall into that category. This is a legitimate typo that should be fixed for code quality. Documentation quality matters, and fixing typos improves readability. The comment is actionable and clear, which the rules say is good for code quality refactors. While documentation quality does matter, the rules explicitly state not to make comments that are \"obvious or unimportant.\" A single-word typo in a javadoc comment is quite minor and could be considered unimportant compared to functional code issues. The rules seem to prioritize avoiding noise over catching every small issue. This comment identifies a real but very minor typo in documentation. Given the rules emphasize avoiding unimportant comments and the low impact of this issue, I should delete this comment. It's the kind of minor documentation issue that doesn't warrant blocking or cluttering a PR review.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>11. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/LazyLoadFragment.java:67</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> Typographical error: consider replacing \"in to\" with \"into\" in the comment (\"...restored in to the view\").\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 20% vs. threshold = 50% This is a comment about a typo in documentation. While it's technically correct that \"into\" is more proper than \"in to\" in this context, I need to consider the review rules. The rules state: \"Do NOT comment unless there is clearly a code change required\" and \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant.\" A typo in a comment/documentation is not a code change - it doesn't affect functionality. This is a very minor documentation issue that doesn't impact the code's behavior. The rules emphasize only keeping comments that require clear code changes, and this is just a stylistic/grammatical suggestion for documentation. However, code quality includes documentation quality, and fixing typos in documentation could be considered a valid improvement. The comment is actionable and clear, which the rules say is good for code quality refactors. While documentation quality matters, the rules explicitly state not to comment on obvious or unimportant things. A minor typo in a javadoc comment is both obvious (once pointed out) and relatively unimportant compared to functional code issues.

Looking at the rules: 1) The rule says \"Do NOT comment unless there is clearly a code change required\" - this is a documentation typo, not a code change. 2) The rule says \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant\" - fixing a typo in documentation could be considered minor/unimportant. 3) However, the rules also say \"Comments that suggest code quality refactors are good! But only if they are actionable and clear\" - this is actionable and clear. But is fixing a typo really a \"code quality refactor\"? It's more of a documentation quality issue. The most important consideration is: does this require a code change? It's just a typo in a comment. While it would be nice to fix, it's not critical and falls under \"obvious or unimportant\" changes. The automated tool is being overly pedantic about a minor typo in documentation. While the typo is real and the suggestion is correct, documentation typos are generally considered minor issues. The rules explicitly state not to make \"obvious or unimportant\" comments, and a single-word typo in a JavaDoc comment could fall into this category. Additionally, this doesn't affect code functionality at all. Although the typo is minor, it's in newly added documentation and fixing it would improve code quality. However, the rules prioritize avoiding unimportant comments, and a documentation typo that doesn't affect functionality is likely not important enough to warrant keeping the comment. The bar for keeping comments is high - \"STRONG EVIDENCE that the comment is correct\" - and while correct, this is too minor. This comment should be deleted. While the typo is real, it's a minor documentation issue that falls under \"obvious or unimportant\" comments according to the rules. The automated tool is being overly pedantic about a trivial typo that doesn't affect code functionality.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> \n> Workflow ID: <workflowid>`wflow_9ayYUp98gHG48qpi`</workflowid>\n> </details>\n> \n> <sup>You can customize </sup>[<img alt=\"Ellipsis\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Ellipsis-blue?color=175173\">](https://www.ellipsis.dev?ref=sheepdestroyer%2Fmaterialisheep&utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral)<sup> by changing your [verbosity settings](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/settings/code-review), reacting with :+1: or :-1:, [replying to comments](https://docs.ellipsis.dev/features/code-review#teaching-ellipsis), or adding [code review rules](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/code-review/rules).</sup>",

Now `eagerLoad()` only checks `isEagerLoad()` and always calls `load()`, so multiple invocations (e.g., repeated `loadNow()` or visibility changes) can trigger repeated loads. Please reintroduce the `!isLoaded()` check:\n\n```java\nfinal void eagerLoad() {\n    if (mViewModel.isEagerLoad() && !mViewModel.isLoaded()) {\n        mViewModel.setLoaded(true);\n        load();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nand ensure `STATE_LOADED` is restored from the ViewModel if that flag must be persisted.",

Now we only check `mViewModel.isEagerLoad()`, always set `setLoaded(true)`, and never read the loaded state, so repeated `eagerLoad()` calls (e.g. via `loadNow()` or visibility changes) will re-invoke `load()`. Unless `load()` is guaranteed idempotent, this is a behavioral regression. Please reintroduce a loaded guard using the ViewModel state, e.g. `if (mViewModel.isEagerLoad() && !mViewModel.isLoaded()) { mViewModel.setLoaded(true); load(); }`.",

item and list activities from custom ViewPager to ViewPager2 with FragmentStateAdapter and TabLayoutMediator, and re-home FAB/navigation logic around ViewPager2 callbacks. | <ul><li>Replace custom ViewPager fields with ViewPager2 in BaseListActivity and ItemActivity and update fullscreen handling to use setUserInputEnabled</li><li>Instantiate ItemPagerAdapter as a FragmentStateAdapter-backed adapter and attach it directly to ViewPager2</li><li>Use TabLayoutMediator to bind TabLayout to ViewPager2 and move tab/fab behavior into ViewPager2.OnPageChangeCallback and TabLayout listeners</li><li>Introduce helper methods that retrieve the current fragment via FragmentManager tags and use them for navigation, back interception, lazy loading, and scrolling</li></ul> | `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/BaseListActivity.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/ItemActivity.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/widget/ItemPagerAdapter.java`<br/>`app/src/main/res/layout-w820dp-land/activity_list.xml`<br/>`app/src/main/res/layout/activity_item.xml` |\n| Refactor ItemPagerAdapter from FragmentStatePagerAdapter to FragmentStateAdapter and simplify binding responsibilities. | <ul><li>Change ItemPagerAdapter to extend FragmentStateAdapter, implement createFragment/getItemCount, and remove internal fragment caching</li><li>Remove legacy bind/unbind methods that configured ViewPager, TabLayout, and FABs, delegating that wiring to the hosting activities</li><li>Expose getPageTitle for use by TabLayoutMediator while preserving existing tab titles</li></ul> | `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/widget/ItemPagerAdapter.java` |\n| Replace setRetainInstance-based lazy loading with a ViewModel-backed LazyLoadFragment implementation. | <ul><li>Introduce LazyLoadViewModel to hold eagerLoad/loaded/initialized flags across configuration changes</li><li>Update LazyLoadFragment to obtain LazyLoadViewModel in onCreate, initialize eager-load state once, and move lazy-load gating logic to the ViewModel</li><li>Switch from onActivityCreated to onViewCreated for triggering eagerLoad and adjust loadNow/isNewInstance/eagerLoad behavior accordingly</li><li>Add setUserVisibleHint override to toggle eager loading when the fragment becomes visible</li></ul> | `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/LazyLoadFragment.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/LazyLoadViewModel.java` |\n| Modernize fragment lifecycle and menu handling by using onViewCreated and MenuProvider instead of deprecated APIs. | <ul><li>Replace BaseFragment.onActivityCreated with onViewCreated and register a MenuProvider tied to the view lifecycle for menu creation and preparation</li><li>Remove obsolete onCreate/onActivityCreated/menu-related calls from BaseListFragment, FavoriteFragment, and WebFragment, relying on BaseFragment\u2019s menu integration</li><li>Migrate ListFragment\u2019s setup work from onActivityCreated to onViewCreated while preserving LiveData observation and ItemManager initialization</li></ul> | `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/BaseFragment.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/BaseListFragment.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/FavoriteFragment.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/ListFragment.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/WebFragment.java` |\n| Remove the custom ViewPager wrapper and associated deprecated behavior. | <ul><li>Delete the custom widget ViewPager class now that ViewPager2 is used</li><li>Update layout resources to point to androidx.viewpager2.widget.ViewPager2 instead of the custom ViewPager</li></ul> | `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/widget/ViewPager.java`<br/>`app/src/main/res/layout-w820dp-land/activity_list.xml`<br/>`app/src/main/res/layout/activity_item.xml` |\n\n###

    "body": "## Summary of Changes\n\nHello @sheepdestroyer, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request significantly modernizes the application's UI and Fragment management by adopting contemporary AndroidX components and lifecycle practices. The core changes involve upgrading the paging mechanism from the legacy ViewPager to ViewPager2, streamlining Fragment lifecycle callbacks, and introducing ViewModel for robust state retention. These updates enhance maintainability, improve performance, and ensure compatibility with the latest Android development standards.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **ViewPager2 Migration**: The application has been migrated from the deprecated `ViewPager` and `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` to the modern `ViewPager2` and `FragmentStateAdapter` for improved performance and integration with AndroidX.\n* **Fragment Lifecycle Modernization**: Deprecated Fragment lifecycle methods like `onActivityCreated` have been replaced with `onViewCreated` across several fragments (`BaseFragment`, `BaseListFragment`, `FavoriteFragment`, `LazyLoadFragment`, `ListFragment`) to align with current Android development best practices.\n* **State Retention with ViewModel**: The `setRetainInstance` method, which is now deprecated, has been replaced by a new `LazyLoadViewModel` to manage the state of `LazyLoadFragment` instances, ensuring proper data retention across configuration changes.\n* **Modern Menu Handling**: Menu creation and preparation in `BaseFragment` have been updated to use the `androidx.core.view.MenuProvider` API, replacing the older, deprecated Fragment menu callbacks.\n* **Custom ViewPager Removal**: The custom `io.github.sheepdestroyer.materialisheep.widget.ViewPager` class has been removed, as its functionality (swipe enabling) is now handled directly by `ViewPager2`'s `setUserInputEnabled` method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`. Below is a summary of the supported commands on the current page.\n\nFeature | Command | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nCode Review | `/gemini review` | Performs a code review for the current pull request in its current state.\nPull Request Summary | `/gemini summary` | Provides a summary of the current pull request in its current state.\nComment | @gemini-code-assist | Responds in comments when explicitly tagged, both in pull request comments and review comments.\nHelp | `/gemini help` | Displays a list of available commands.\n\n<b>Customization</b>\n\nTo customize Gemini Code Assist for GitHub experience, repository maintainers can create a configuration file and/or provide a custom code review style guide (such as PEP-8 for Python) by creating and adding files to a `.gemini/` folder in the base of the repository. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/customize-gemini-behavior-github).\n\n<b>Limitations & Feedback</b>\n\nGemini Code Assist may make mistakes.

It offers a free tier with a monthly limit of PR reviews per organization, with subscription options available for higher usage.\r\n\r\n- **15+ Automated Workflow Tools Including:**\r\n  - `/describe`: Automatically generates pull request descriptions, titles, changes walkthroughs, and more.\r\n  - `/compliance`:  Generates comprehensive compliance checks on PR code changes, task ticket requirements, and custom organizational compliance checklists.\r\n  - `/review`: Generates a high-level review guide with key issues.\r\n  - `/improve`: Iterate on PRs with dynamic, context-aware code suggestions.\r\n\r\n- **Context-Aware Code Reviews and Suggestions:**\r\n   Qodo Merge fetches context from your PR data, tickets, and collects your best practices to generate relevant code suggestions and feedback.\r\n\r\n- **Automatic Learning:**\r\n  Qodo Merge looks for repeated patterns in the suggestions that you accept and applies learnings to future code suggestions.\r\n\r\n- **AI Chat (Available via the [Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/qodo-merge-ai-powered-cod/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) only):**\r\n  Ask targeted questions about specific code changes and receive context-aware answers within the pull request comment section.\r\n\r\n**Qodo Merge Benefits:**\r\n\r\n- Tailor Qodo Merge to your workflows and coding practices with custom configurations, labels, and best practices.\r\n- Fully managed: hosting, models, regular updates, and more. Installation is as simple as signing up and adding the Qodo Merge app to your GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repo.\r\n- Leverage top-tier models for AI-powered code reviews with GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5.\r\n- Secure and private: No data is stored or used to train models. Qodo Merge employs zero data retention and only uses OpenAI and Claude accounts with zero data retention.\r\n\r\n**Installation Instructions:** \r\n- Make sure you can see a \"Configure\" button at the top of the page. If the button is not visible, ensure you are logged in to GitHub account and refresh the page. \r\n- Click the \"Configure\" button and follow the instructions.",

If this method is relied on to trigger loading when a page becomes visible, pages may never load as expected. Consider using ViewPager2 page callbacks plus fragment `loadNow()` (as you already do) and/or `FragmentTransaction#setMaxLifecycle` patterns instead of `setUserVisibleHint()`.\n</summary>\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void setUserVisibleHint(boolean isVisibleToUser) {\n    super.setUserVisibleHint(isVisibleToUser);\n    if (isVisibleToUser && !mViewModel.isLoaded()) {\n        mViewModel.setEagerLoad(true);\n        eagerLoad();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><a href='https://github.com/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/pull/56/files#diff-cd1bd6c16056eabdbb05b9b46cd4f05e46572722c428ea2fa7bb3250beeb6545R186-R192'><strong>Possible Issue</strong></a>\n\nThere is a duplicate assignment to `mNavButton` with `findViewById()`. This is harmless but suggests a copy/paste oversight and makes it easier to miss real initialization issues (e.g., if one of the IDs changes later).\n</summary>\n\n```java\nmReplyButton = findViewById(R.id.reply_button);\nmNavButton = findViewById(R.id.navigation_button);\nmNavButton = findViewById(R.id.navigation_button);\nmNavButton.setNavigable(direction ->\n// if callback is fired navigable should not be null\nAppUtils.navigate(direction, mAppBar, (Navigable) getFragment(0)));\nmVoteButton = findViewById(R.id.vote_button);\n```\n\n</details>\n\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n",
