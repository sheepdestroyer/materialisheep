Now `eagerLoad()` only checks `isEagerLoad()` and always calls `load()`, so multiple invocations (e.g., repeated `loadNow()` or visibility changes) can trigger repeated loads. Please reintroduce the `!isLoaded()` check:\n\n```java\nfinal void eagerLoad() {\n    if (mViewModel.isEagerLoad() && !mViewModel.isLoaded()) {\n        mViewModel.setLoaded(true);\n        load();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nand ensure `STATE_LOADED` is restored from the ViewModel if that flag must be persisted.\n</issue_to_address>\n\n### Comment 2\n<location> `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/LazyLoadFragment.java:39-48` </location>\n<code_context>\n      */\n-    @SuppressWarnings(\"deprecation\") // Using deprecated onActivityCreated; migration to onViewCreated requires\n-                                     // refactoring\n-    @Override\n-    public void onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n-        super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);\n</code_context>\n\n<issue_to_address>\n**suggestion:** Using `setUserVisibleHint` is deprecated and won\u2019t be triggered by ViewPager2.\n\nWith ViewPager2 + FragmentStateAdapter, `setUserVisibleHint` is never invoked because visibility is controlled via `setMaxLifecycle`, so this method is effectively dead code and can mislead future maintenance around lazy loading.\n\nGiven that `loadNow()` is already triggered from the ViewPager2 `OnPageChangeCallback`, you can remove this override. If you still need lifecycle-driven loading, tie it to fragment lifecycle callbacks (e.g., `onResume` with the adapter\u2019s current item) instead of `setUserVisibleHint`.\n</issue_to_address>\n~~~\n\n</details>\n\n***\n\n<details>\n<summary>Sourcery is free for open source - if you like our reviews please consider sharing them \u2728</summary>\n\n- [X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/share?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://sourcery.ai)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://sourcery.ai)\n\n</details>\n\n<sub>\nHelp me be more useful!

The comment is technically correct - setUserVisibleHint is deprecated. However, I need to consider the rules: the PR is migrating from setRetainInstance to ViewModel, which is already a significant refactoring. The author may have intentionally kept setUserVisibleHint for now as part of a gradual migration. The comment suggests alternatives but doesn't provide specific actionable code. It's more of a \"you should consider\" type comment rather than pointing out a clear bug. Given the context that this is already a migration PR, the author likely knows about this deprecation and may be addressing it incrementally. The author is already doing a significant refactoring to migrate to ViewModel. They may be aware of the deprecation and intentionally keeping this for now. The comment doesn't show that this causes a concrete problem, just that it's deprecated. Without knowing if there's a specific issue this causes, this might be premature optimization feedback. While the author may be aware of the deprecation, adding deprecated APIs in new code is generally a code smell. However, the comment is somewhat speculative (\"consider using\") rather than pointing to a definite issue. The rules state not to make speculative comments and to only comment if there's clearly a code change required. This comment points out a deprecated API but is more of a suggestion than identifying a clear bug or required change. Given the rules against speculative comments and the fact that this is already a refactoring PR, this comment should be deleted as it's not pointing to a definite issue that must be fixed.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>2. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/BaseListActivity.java:578</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> Unbind logic removes fragments using hardcoded tags 'f0' and 'f1'; ensure these tags remain valid if the page count ever changes.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Comment did not seem useful.

While technically correct, I need to consider if this is \"obvious or unimportant\" according to the rules. The typo is minor - \"in to\" vs \"into\" - and doesn't affect code functionality. However, looking more closely at the diff, this JavaDoc comment appears to be copied from Android's standard documentation for onViewCreated. The text \"restored in to the view\" is actually the original Android documentation text. If this is copied from the Android SDK documentation, then the author likely copied it verbatim and changing it might not be appropriate. But I can't be 100% sure without checking the Android source. The comment is very minor and could be considered \"obvious or unimportant\" - it's just a small grammatical issue in a comment that doesn't affect functionality. This could be standard Android documentation that was copied verbatim, in which case changing it might not be appropriate. Also, even if it's a legitimate typo, it's extremely minor and could fall under \"obvious or unimportant\" comments that should not be made. While it might be standard documentation, I cannot verify that without additional context. However, the rule about \"obvious or unimportant\" comments is clear - this is a very minor grammatical issue in documentation that has no impact on code functionality. Such minor typo corrections typically fall into the category of unimportant comments. This comment should be deleted. It's pointing out a very minor grammatical typo in documentation that has no functional impact. This falls under the rule against \"obvious or unimportant\" comments. Additionally, the JavaDoc may be copied from Android's standard documentation, making the change potentially inappropriate.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>7. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/LazyLoadFragment.java:67</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> Typographical suggestion: On line 67, consider replacing \"in to\" with \"into\" for better readability.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 20% vs. threshold = 50% This is a comment about a typo in documentation/comments. Looking at the rules, I need to check: 1) Is this about a code change? Yes, the javadoc comment was added in this diff. 2) Does it require a code change? It's suggesting a typo fix, which is very minor. 3) Is it obvious or unimportant? This is a very minor typo fix in a comment. The rules say \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant.\" A typo in documentation is quite minor and could be considered unimportant. 4) The rules emphasize not making comments unless there is \"clearly a code change required\" - a typo in a comment is not really a code change that affects functionality. This seems like the kind of nitpicky comment that should be filtered out. While fixing typos improves code quality, this is an extremely minor issue in a comment that doesn't affect functionality. The rules specifically say not to make obvious or unimportant comments, and a two-word typo in documentation could fall into that category. You're right that this is very minor. The rules emphasize not making comments unless there's clearly a code change required, and fixing \"in to\" vs \"into\" in a javadoc comment is not a critical code change. This is the type of nitpicky, unimportant comment that should be filtered out. This comment should be deleted. While it correctly identifies a typo, it's an unimportant and obvious issue in documentation that doesn't warrant a review comment according to the rules.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>8. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/ListFragment.java:185</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> Typo in the documentation comment: consider using \"into\" instead of \"in to\" in the phrase \"restored in to the view.\"\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 20% vs. threshold = 50% This is a documentation typo fix suggestion. The rules state \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant.\" A typo in documentation could be considered minor/unimportant. However, the rules also say \"Comments that suggest code quality refactors are good! But only if they are actionable and clear.\" This is actionable and clear - it's a simple typo fix. The question is whether fixing a documentation typo counts as important enough. The phrase \"in to\" vs \"into\" is indeed incorrect grammar - \"into\" is the correct preposition here. However, this is a very minor issue in a comment that was just added. The rules emphasize not commenting unless there's \"clearly a code change required\" and to avoid \"obvious or unimportant\" comments. A documentation typo, while technically incorrect, is quite minor and doesn't affect functionality. This seems to fall into the \"unimportant\" category. While the typo is real and the fix is correct, documentation typos are generally considered minor issues. The comment doesn't affect code functionality, and the meaning is still clear despite the grammatical error. This might be too pedantic for a code review. Even though it's minor, documentation quality matters for maintainability. However, the rules explicitly state not to make \"obvious or unimportant\" comments, and a small grammatical error in documentation that doesn't affect understanding likely falls into this category. The bar for keeping comments should be high. This comment points out a legitimate typo, but it's a very minor documentation issue that doesn't affect code functionality or clarity. Given the rules emphasize avoiding unimportant comments, this should be deleted.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> \n> Workflow ID: <workflowid>`wflow_aWmqFbXzZ6ycdrMk`</workflowid>\n> </details>\n> \n> <sup>You can customize </sup>[<img alt=\"Ellipsis\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Ellipsis-blue?color=175173\">](https://www.ellipsis.dev?ref=sheepdestroyer%2Fmaterialisheep&utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral)<sup> by changing your [verbosity settings](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/settings/code-review), reacting with :+1: or :-1:, [replying to comments](https://docs.ellipsis.dev/features/code-review#teaching-ellipsis), or adding [code review rules](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/code-review/rules).</sup>",

    "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis pull request is a significant and well-executed refactoring to modernize the app's architecture. The migration from the deprecated `ViewPager` and `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` to `ViewPager2` and `FragmentStateAdapter` is a great improvement. I also appreciate the modernization of Fragment APIs, such as replacing `onActivityCreated` with `onViewCreated`, using `MenuProvider` for menus, and adopting `ViewModel` for state retention instead of `setRetainInstance`. The code is cleaner and follows current Android best practices. I've left a few minor suggestions to further improve code quality and maintainability, but overall this is excellent work.",

Now we only check `mViewModel.isEagerLoad()`, always set `setLoaded(true)`, and never read the loaded state, so repeated `eagerLoad()` calls (e.g. via `loadNow()` or visibility changes) will re-invoke `load()`. Unless `load()` is guaranteed idempotent, this is a behavioral regression. Please reintroduce a loaded guard using the ViewModel state, e.g. `if (mViewModel.isEagerLoad() && !mViewModel.isLoaded()) { mViewModel.setLoaded(true); load(); }`.\n</issue_to_address>\n\n### Comment 2\n<location> `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/LazyLoadFragment.java:39-48` </location>\n<code_context>\n      */\n-    @SuppressWarnings(\"deprecation\") // Using deprecated onActivityCreated; migration to onViewCreated requires\n-                                     // refactoring\n-    @Override\n-    public void onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n-        super.onActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);\n</code_context>\n\n<issue_to_address>\n**issue (bug_risk):** Using setUserVisibleHint() with ViewPager2 is deprecated and likely ineffective.\n\nThis means the lazy-load check (`if (isVisibleToUser && !mViewModel.isLoaded())`) may never run as intended. Instead, trigger lazy loading from lifecycle callbacks (`onStart`/`onResume`) or from ViewPager2\u2019s page change callbacks (similar to how `loadNow()` is used in Activities), and drive any per-page visibility handling from those callbacks rather than `setUserVisibleHint()`.\n</issue_to_address>\n\n### Comment 3\n<location> `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/BaseListActivity.java:531-540` </location>\n<code_context>\n+        mViewPager.setAdapter(mAdapter);\n</code_context>\n\n<issue_to_address>\n**issue (bug_risk):** TabLayoutMediator and callbacks are never detached, which can leak and cause duplicate callbacks on rebind.\n\n`bindViewPager()` now creates a `TabLayoutMediator`, a `ViewPager2.OnPageChangeCallback`, and a `TabLayout.OnTabSelectedListener`, but `unbindViewPager()` only removes fragments. If `bindViewPager()` is invoked multiple times, you\u2019ll accumulate mediators and callbacks, leading to leaks and duplicate events. Store these as fields and clean them up in `unbindViewPager()` (e.g. `mediator.detach()`, `mViewPager.unregisterOnPageChangeCallback(...)`, `mTabLayout.removeOnTabSelectedListener(...)`).\n</issue_to_address>\n\n### Comment 4\n<location> `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/ItemActivity.java:186-187` </location>\n<code_context>\n         mSystemUiHelper = new AppUtils.SystemUiHelper(getWindow());\n         mReplyButton = findViewById(R.id.reply_button);\n         mNavButton = findViewById(R.id.navigation_button);\n+        mNavButton = findViewById(R.id.navigation_button);\n         mNavButton.setNavigable(direction ->\n</code_context>\n\n<issue_to_address>\n**nitpick:** mNavButton is assigned twice in a row; the first assignment appears redundant.\n\nIn `onCreate`, `mNavButton` is assigned twice with `findViewById(R.id.navigation_button)` in consecutive lines; the second is redundant and should be removed, or the ID corrected if a different view was intended.\n</issue_to_address>\n~~~\n\n</details>\n\n***\n\n<details>\n<summary>Sourcery is free for open source - if you like our reviews please consider sharing them \u2728</summary>\n\n- [X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/share?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://sourcery.ai)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://sourcery.ai)\n\n</details>\n\n<sub>\nHelp me be more useful!

    "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis pull request is a great step forward in modernizing the app's architecture by migrating from the deprecated `ViewPager` and `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` to `ViewPager2` and `FragmentStateAdapter`. The changes also correctly replace other deprecated APIs like `onActivityCreated`, `setRetainInstance`, and fragment menu methods with their modern counterparts (`onViewCreated`, `ViewModel`, and `MenuProvider`).\n\nThe implementation is solid overall, but I've identified a few issues:\n- A duplicated line of code in `ItemActivity`.\n- A potential bug in `LazyLoadFragment` that could cause data to be loaded multiple times.\n- Some redundant code in `LazyLoadFragment` due to API changes in `ViewPager2`.\n\nI've left specific comments with suggestions to address these points. Once these are fixed, this will be a very strong contribution to the codebase's health.",

However, the comment is phrased as \"Consider migrating... in future revisions\" which makes it sound like a suggestion for future work rather than something that needs to be fixed now. According to the rules, comments should be about clear code changes required, not speculative or informational. The phrase \"in future revisions\" suggests this is not urgent or required for this PR. Additionally, if setUserVisibleHint is deprecated, that would likely be caught by the build system with a deprecation warning, which falls under \"anything that would be obviously caught by the build.\" The author might be intentionally using setUserVisibleHint because they're maintaining compatibility with older Android versions or because a full migration to the newer approach would require more extensive refactoring. The comment could be useful as a reminder for future work, even if it's not actionable now. While the comment might be useful as a future reminder, the rules explicitly state not to make comments unless there is clearly a code change required. The phrase \"in future revisions\" indicates this is not a required change for this PR. Additionally, deprecation warnings would be caught by the build system, so this falls under things that would be \"obviously caught by the build.\" This comment should be deleted because it's phrased as a suggestion for future work (\"in future revisions\") rather than a required change for this PR.

However, I need to check the rules carefully. The rules state \"Do NOT comment unless there is clearly a code change required\" and \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant.\" A typo in a javadoc comment is relatively minor and could be considered unimportant. However, looking at the diff more carefully, I notice that this javadoc text appears to be copied from Android's standard documentation (it's describing onViewCreated). The text \"in to\" might actually be from the original Android documentation that was copied. But wait - this is still just a documentation typo, not a functional code issue. The rules emphasize not making obvious or unimportant comments, and a minor typo in documentation could fall into that category. This is a legitimate typo that should be fixed for code quality. Documentation quality matters, and fixing typos improves readability. The comment is actionable and clear, which the rules say is good for code quality refactors. While documentation quality does matter, the rules explicitly state not to make comments that are \"obvious or unimportant.\" A single-word typo in a javadoc comment is quite minor and could be considered unimportant compared to functional code issues. The rules seem to prioritize avoiding noise over catching every small issue. This comment identifies a real but very minor typo in documentation. Given the rules emphasize avoiding unimportant comments and the low impact of this issue, I should delete this comment. It's the kind of minor documentation issue that doesn't warrant blocking or cluttering a PR review.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>11. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/LazyLoadFragment.java:67</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> Typographical error: consider replacing \"in to\" with \"into\" in the comment (\"...restored in to the view\").\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 20% vs. threshold = 50% This is a comment about a typo in documentation. While it's technically correct that \"into\" is more proper than \"in to\" in this context, I need to consider the review rules. The rules state: \"Do NOT comment unless there is clearly a code change required\" and \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant.\" A typo in a comment/documentation is not a code change - it doesn't affect functionality. This is a very minor documentation issue that doesn't impact the code's behavior. The rules emphasize only keeping comments that require clear code changes, and this is just a stylistic/grammatical suggestion for documentation. However, code quality includes documentation quality, and fixing typos in documentation could be considered a valid improvement. The comment is actionable and clear, which the rules say is good for code quality refactors. While documentation quality matters, the rules explicitly state not to comment on obvious or unimportant things. A minor typo in a javadoc comment is both obvious (once pointed out) and relatively unimportant compared to functional code issues.

Looking at the rules: 1) The rule says \"Do NOT comment unless there is clearly a code change required\" - this is a documentation typo, not a code change. 2) The rule says \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant\" - fixing a typo in documentation could be considered minor/unimportant. 3) However, the rules also say \"Comments that suggest code quality refactors are good! But only if they are actionable and clear\" - this is actionable and clear. But is fixing a typo really a \"code quality refactor\"? It's more of a documentation quality issue. The most important consideration is: does this require a code change? It's just a typo in a comment. While it would be nice to fix, it's not critical and falls under \"obvious or unimportant\" changes. The automated tool is being overly pedantic about a minor typo in documentation. While the typo is real and the suggestion is correct, documentation typos are generally considered minor issues. The rules explicitly state not to make \"obvious or unimportant\" comments, and a single-word typo in a JavaDoc comment could fall into this category. Additionally, this doesn't affect code functionality at all. Although the typo is minor, it's in newly added documentation and fixing it would improve code quality. However, the rules prioritize avoiding unimportant comments, and a documentation typo that doesn't affect functionality is likely not important enough to warrant keeping the comment. The bar for keeping comments is high - \"STRONG EVIDENCE that the comment is correct\" - and while correct, this is too minor. This comment should be deleted. While the typo is real, it's a minor documentation issue that falls under \"obvious or unimportant\" comments according to the rules. The automated tool is being overly pedantic about a trivial typo that doesn't affect code functionality.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> \n> Workflow ID: <workflowid>`wflow_9ayYUp98gHG48qpi`</workflowid>\n> </details>\n> \n> <sup>You can customize </sup>[<img alt=\"Ellipsis\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Ellipsis-blue?color=175173\">](https://www.ellipsis.dev?ref=sheepdestroyer%2Fmaterialisheep&utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral)<sup> by changing your [verbosity settings](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/settings/code-review), reacting with :+1: or :-1:, [replying to comments](https://docs.ellipsis.dev/features/code-review#teaching-ellipsis), or adding [code review rules](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/code-review/rules).</sup>",

It also relies on `commitAllowingStateLoss`, which risks silently dropping these removals. Instead, derive removals from `mViewPager.getAdapter().getItemCount()` (or let the adapter manage its fragments) and prefer `commit()` where feasible.\n\nSuggested implementation:\n\n```java\n        if (mTabSelectedListener != null) {\n            mTabLayout.removeOnTabSelectedListener(mTabSelectedListener);\n            mTabSelectedListener = null;\n        }\n\n        RecyclerView.Adapter<?> adapter = mViewPager.getAdapter();\n        if (adapter instanceof FragmentStateAdapter) {\n            FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();\n            FragmentTransaction transaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();\n\n            int itemCount = adapter.getItemCount();\n            for (int position = 0; position < itemCount; position++) {\n                long itemId = ((FragmentStateAdapter) adapter).getItemId(position);\n                String tag = \"f\" + itemId;\n                Fragment fragment = fragmentManager.findFragmentByTag(tag);\n                if (fragment != null) {\n                    transaction.remove(fragment);\n                }\n            }\n\n            transaction.commit();\n        }\n\n/**\n\n```\n\nTo compile successfully, ensure the following imports exist at the top of `BaseListActivity.java` (or equivalent are already present):\n\n```java\nimport androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView;\nimport androidx.viewpager2.adapter.FragmentStateAdapter;\nimport androidx.fragment.app.Fragment;\nimport androidx.fragment.app.FragmentManager;\nimport androidx.fragment.app.FragmentTransaction;\n```\n\nIf your `ItemPagerAdapter` uses a custom tag format or overrides how fragments are tagged, adjust the `tag` construction (`\"f\" + itemId`) to match that scheme.\n</issue_to_address>\n~~~\n\n</details>\n\n***\n\n<details>\n<summary>Sourcery is free for open source - if you like our reviews please consider sharing them \u2728</summary>\n\n- [X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/share?text=I%20just%20got%20an%20instant%20code%20review%20from%20%40SourceryAI%2C%20and%20it%20was%20brilliant%21%20It%27s%20free%20for%20open%20source%20and%20has%20a%20free%20trial%20for%20private%20code.%20Check%20it%20out%20https%3A//sourcery.ai)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://sourcery.ai)\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://sourcery.ai)\n\n</details>\n\n<sub>\nHelp me be more useful!

    "body": "## Code Review\n\nThis pull request is a significant and well-executed refactoring to modernize the app's architecture by migrating from the deprecated `ViewPager` to `ViewPager2` and updating Fragment lifecycle methods. The introduction of `ViewModel` for state management instead of `setRetainInstance` is a great improvement. The code is cleaner and follows modern Android development practices. I've identified a potential memory leak in `ItemActivity` where `TabLayoutMediator` is not being detached, some dead code in `LazyLoadFragment`, and a minor style issue in `BaseListActivity`. Addressing these points will further improve the code's robustness and maintainability.",

However, the code uses `addMenuProvider(menuProvider, lifecycleOwner, state)` with `getViewLifecycleOwner()` as the lifecycle owner. This is the recommended pattern in Android - when you provide a LifecycleOwner to addMenuProvider, the framework automatically removes the MenuProvider when that lifecycle is destroyed. The view lifecycle owner is destroyed in onDestroyView, so the MenuProvider should be automatically cleaned up. This comment appears to be incorrect because it's asking for manual cleanup that isn't necessary and would be redundant. The comment also violates the rule about not asking the author to \"ensure\" something. I might be wrong about the automatic cleanup behavior. Perhaps there's a specific bug or edge case in the MenuProvider API where manual removal is still needed even with a LifecycleOwner. I should consider that the automated tool might have knowledge of such issues that I'm not aware of. While there could be edge cases, the standard Android documentation and best practices indicate that using addMenuProvider with a LifecycleOwner parameter handles cleanup automatically. The comment doesn't provide any specific evidence of a problem, and asking to \"ensure\" something is done falls under the category of comments we should remove. Without strong evidence that manual cleanup is needed here, this appears to be an incorrect suggestion. This comment should be deleted. The MenuProvider is properly scoped to the view lifecycle owner, which means Android will automatically remove it when the view is destroyed. Manual removal in onDestroyView would be redundant. Additionally, the comment starts with \"Ensure that...\" which is explicitly mentioned as a pattern to avoid in the rules.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>2. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/BaseListActivity.java:611</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> Relying on fragment tags ('f'+position) for getFragment may be brittle; verify that this tagging scheme remains consistent with ViewPager2.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Comment looked like it was already resolved.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>3. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/ItemActivity.java:405</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> The migration to ViewPager2 looks good; ensure getFragment() reliably fetches the correct fragment and that FAB toggling synchronizes with page changes.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Comment was not on a location in the diff, so it can't be submitted as a review comment.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>4. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/LazyLoadFragment.java:101</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> setUserVisibleHint is deprecated; consider using FragmentTransaction#setMaxLifecycle or Lifecycle observers for visibility handling.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 30% vs. threshold = 50% The `setUserVisibleHint` override is indeed being added in this PR (it's in the diff as new code). The comment is technically correct that this method is deprecated. However, I need to consider: 1) This is a migration PR that's moving from `setRetainInstance` to ViewModel, so the author is already doing modernization work. 2) The comment suggests an alternative approach but doesn't provide concrete implementation details. 3) The author may have intentionally kept this deprecated method for compatibility reasons or because they're doing incremental migration. 4) The comment is somewhat speculative - it's suggesting a refactor but not pointing out a definite bug. 5) According to the rules, comments suggesting code quality refactors are good if they are actionable and clear, but this one is somewhat vague about how to implement the alternative. The author is clearly doing modernization work (migrating to ViewModel), so they may be aware of the deprecation but chose to keep this method for now. The comment doesn't explain why this is a problem or provide concrete steps to fix it. It's possible the deprecated method is still needed for backward compatibility or the author is doing incremental migration. While the author is doing modernization, the comment does point out a legitimate issue with newly added code using a deprecated API. However, the comment lacks specificity and actionable guidance - it just mentions alternatives without explaining how to implement them in this specific context. This makes it more of an informational comment than an actionable one, which violates the rules. The comment should be deleted. While it's technically correct that `setUserVisibleHint` is deprecated, the comment is not sufficiently actionable - it merely suggests alternatives without providing concrete implementation guidance.

Looking at the rules: \"Do NOT comment unless there is clearly a code change required\" - this is just a documentation typo, not a code change. The rules also say \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant\" - fixing a typo is relatively minor. However, the comment is technically correct - \"in to\" should be \"into\" in this context. But the rules emphasize not making comments unless there's a clear code change required, and typos in comments are generally low priority. The most important rule states I should only keep comments with STRONG EVIDENCE that they are correct and important. While the typo is real, it's a minor documentation issue, not a functional code problem. The typo is real and the suggestion is technically correct. Documentation quality matters, and fixing typos improves code quality. This could be considered an actionable code quality improvement, even if it's just in a comment. While the typo is real, the rules explicitly state not to make comments that are \"obvious or unimportant\" and to only comment when there's \"clearly a code change required.\" A minor typo in a javadoc comment doesn't meet the threshold of importance for keeping the comment, especially given the instruction to err on the side of deleting comments unless there's STRONG EVIDENCE they should be kept. This comment should be deleted. While it correctly identifies a typo, it's a minor documentation issue that doesn't meet the threshold for \"clearly a code change required\" and falls under \"obvious or unimportant\" comments that should be avoided.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> <details>\n> <summary>12. <code>app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/ListFragment.java:185</code></summary>\n> \n> - **Draft comment:** \n> Typo: Consider changing \"in to\" to \"into\" in the Javadoc comment.\n> - **Reason this comment was not posted:**\n> Decided after close inspection that this draft comment was likely wrong and/or not actionable: usefulness confidence = 20% vs. threshold = 50% This is a minor typo fix in documentation. While technically correct (both \"in to\" and \"into\" are grammatically acceptable in some contexts, but \"into\" is more standard here), this falls under \"obvious or unimportant\" comments. The comment is about a very minor documentation issue that doesn't affect code functionality. According to the rules, I should \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant.\" A typo like \"in to\" vs \"into\" in a Javadoc comment is quite minor and unimportant. However, I need to consider that this Javadoc appears to be copied from Android framework documentation, so the typo might actually be in the original source. This could be a legitimate documentation improvement, even if minor. Documentation quality matters, and fixing typos improves readability. The comment is actionable and clear. Also, looking at the Javadoc, it appears to be copied from Android's standard documentation for onViewCreated, so the typo might have been introduced during copying or might exist in the original. While documentation quality does matter, this is an extremely minor typo that doesn't affect understanding or functionality. The rules explicitly state \"Do NOT make comments that are obvious or unimportant.\" A single-word spacing issue in a Javadoc comment falls squarely into the \"unimportant\" category. The comment doesn't meet the threshold of being clearly necessary. This comment should be deleted. It's about a very minor typo in documentation that doesn't affect code functionality or understanding. It falls under the category of \"obvious or unimportant\" comments that should not be made according to the rules.\n> \n> \n> </details>\n> \n> \n> Workflow ID: <workflowid>`wflow_4Box9Gdhbs6o0fKc`</workflowid>\n> </details>\n> \n> <sup>You can customize </sup>[<img alt=\"Ellipsis\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Ellipsis-blue?color=175173\">](https://www.ellipsis.dev?ref=sheepdestroyer%2Fmaterialisheep&utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral)<sup> by changing your [verbosity settings](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/settings/code-review), reacting with :+1: or :-1:, [replying to comments](https://docs.ellipsis.dev/features/code-review#teaching-ellipsis), or adding [code review rules](https://app.ellipsis.dev/sheepdestroyer/code-review/rules).</sup>",

    "body": "**issue (bug_risk):** Guard `load()` with the `loaded` flag to avoid repeated loading.\n\nBefore the refactor, `eagerLoad()` guarded `load()` with `!mLoaded`, so it ran at most once per instance even if `loadNow()` or lifecycle events fired multiple times. Now `eagerLoad()` only checks `isEagerLoad()` and always calls `load()`, so multiple invocations (e.g., repeated `loadNow()` or visibility changes) can trigger repeated loads. Please reintroduce the `!isLoaded()` check:\n\n```java\nfinal void eagerLoad() {\n    if (mViewModel.isEagerLoad() && !mViewModel.isLoaded()) {\n        mViewModel.setLoaded(true);\n        load();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nand ensure `STATE_LOADED` is restored from the ViewModel if that flag must be persisted.\n\n\u2705 Addressed in a54e2533e73737e69ab715749c49cab76f498b9e: `eagerLoad()` now checks both `mViewModel.isEagerLoad()` and `!mViewModel.isLoaded()` before setting `loaded` and calling `load()`, restoring the single-load guard via the ViewModel state.",

Now we only check `mViewModel.isEagerLoad()`, always set `setLoaded(true)`, and never read the loaded state, so repeated `eagerLoad()` calls (e.g. via `loadNow()` or visibility changes) will re-invoke `load()`. Unless `load()` is guaranteed idempotent, this is a behavioral regression. Please reintroduce a loaded guard using the ViewModel state, e.g. `if (mViewModel.isEagerLoad() && !mViewModel.isLoaded()) { mViewModel.setLoaded(true); load(); }`.\n\n\u2705 Addressed in a54e2533e73737e69ab715749c49cab76f498b9e: The guard on `eagerLoad()` has been updated to `if (mViewModel.isEagerLoad() && !mViewModel.isLoaded())`, so `load()` is only invoked once per fragment instance.",

    "body": "**suggestion (bug_risk):** Hard-coding fragment tags/indices and using commitAllowingStateLoss makes the unbind logic brittle.\n\nThis assumes the adapter always has exactly two positions with default `itemId`s mapping to tags `\"f0\"` and `\"f1\"`, making the unbind logic tightly coupled to the current `ItemPagerAdapter` and likely to break if page count or IDs change. It also relies on `commitAllowingStateLoss`, which risks silently dropping these removals. Instead, derive removals from `mViewPager.getAdapter().getItemCount()` (or let the adapter manage its fragments) and prefer `commit()` where feasible.\n\nSuggested implementation:\n\n```java\n        if (mTabSelectedListener != null) {\n            mTabLayout.removeOnTabSelectedListener(mTabSelectedListener);\n            mTabSelectedListener = null;\n        }\n\n        RecyclerView.Adapter<?> adapter = mViewPager.getAdapter();\n        if (adapter instanceof FragmentStateAdapter) {\n            FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();\n            FragmentTransaction transaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();\n\n            int itemCount = adapter.getItemCount();\n            for (int position = 0; position < itemCount; position++) {\n                long itemId = ((FragmentStateAdapter) adapter).getItemId(position);\n                String tag = \"f\" + itemId;\n                Fragment fragment = fragmentManager.findFragmentByTag(tag);\n                if (fragment != null) {\n                    transaction.remove(fragment);\n                }\n            }\n\n            transaction.commit();\n        }\n\n/**\n\n```\n\nTo compile successfully, ensure the following imports exist at the top of `BaseListActivity.java` (or equivalent are already present):\n\n```java\nimport androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView;\nimport androidx.viewpager2.adapter.FragmentStateAdapter;\nimport androidx.fragment.app.Fragment;\nimport androidx.fragment.app.FragmentManager;\nimport androidx.fragment.app.FragmentTransaction;\n```\n\nIf your `ItemPagerAdapter` uses a custom tag format or overrides how fragments are tagged, adjust the `tag` construction (`\"f\" + itemId`) to match that scheme.",

FragmentStatePagerAdapter to ViewPager2 + FragmentStateAdapter with TabLayoutMediator and explicit callbacks. | <ul><li>Change BaseListActivity and ItemActivity to use ViewPager2 fields, userInputEnabled, and ViewPager2.OnPageChangeCallback instead of the custom ViewPager and its swipeEnabled API.</li><li>Replace the custom ViewPager widget in activity_list.xml and activity_item.xml with androidx.viewpager2.widget.ViewPager2.</li><li>Refactor ItemPagerAdapter to extend FragmentStateAdapter, implement createFragment/getItemCount, and remove custom bind/unbind methods and fragment caching array.</li><li>Introduce TabLayoutMediator wiring and explicit TabLayout.OnTabSelectedListener implementations in activities to manage tab titles, reselection scroll-to-top, and initial/current page selection.</li><li>Adjust navigation, back handling, and FAB visibility logic to work via Fragment lookups by tag (\"f\" + position) instead of adapter.getItem().</li></ul> | `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/BaseListActivity.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/ItemActivity.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/widget/ItemPagerAdapter.java`<br/>`app/src/main/res/layout-w820dp-land/activity_list.xml`<br/>`app/src/main/res/layout/activity_item.xml`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/widget/ViewPager.java` |\n| Replace deprecated fragment lifecycle/menu APIs with onViewCreated and MenuProvider-based handling and clean up obsolete overrides. | <ul><li>Update BaseFragment to perform menu setup in onViewCreated and register a MenuProvider tied to the view lifecycle owner for menu creation, preparation, and item selection.</li><li>Remove onActivityCreated overrides where they were no-ops or only used for adapter state restoration, moving that work into onViewCreated where needed (e.g., ListFragment).</li><li>Drop setHasOptionsMenu usage in BaseListFragment and WebFragment now that menu handling is centralized via MenuProvider.</li><li>Remove the now redundant onActivityCreated override from FavoriteFragment.</li></ul> | `app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/BaseFragment.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/BaseListFragment.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/FavoriteFragment.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/ListFragment.java`<br/>`app/src/main/java/io/github/sheepdestroyer/materialisheep/WebFragment.java` |\n| Introduce LazyLoadViewModel and rework LazyLoadFragment to use ViewModel-backed state instead of setRetainInstance and manual flags. | <ul><li>Create LazyLoadViewModel to hold eagerLoad/loaded/initialized flags across configuration changes.</li><li>Refactor LazyLoadFragment to obtain a LazyLoadViewModel in onCreate, initialize eager-load state from arguments or savedInstanceState, and store/retrieve state via the ViewModel instead of local booleans and setRetainInstance/getRetainInstance.</li><li>Move lazy-load triggering from onActivityCreated to onViewCreated and base isNewInstance on ViewModel semantics rather than retain instance flags.</li><li>Update eagerLoad/loadNow logic to use the ViewModel flags, and ensure state is saved in onSaveInstanceState while allowing re-loading after restoration.</li></ul> |

replaced with onViewCreated and MenuProvider-based menu handling registered via getViewLifecycleOwner() |\n| **Lazy Load Fragment Updates** <br> `LazyLoadFragment.java` | Replaced onActivityCreated with onViewCreated; added setUserVisibleHint callback; introduced mViewModel (LazyLoadViewModel) to manage eager-load and loaded state across config changes |\n| **Lazy Load ViewModel** <br> `LazyLoadViewModel.java` | New public ViewModel class with boolean state fields (mEagerLoad, mLoaded, mInitialized) and corresponding getters/setters for persistent state management |\n| **List Fragment Lifecycle** <br> `ListFragment.java` | Migrated onActivityCreated to onViewCreated with equivalent logic for observer initialization and adapter configuration |\n| **Web Fragment Menu** <br> `WebFragment.java` | Removed setHasOptionsMenu(true) call, now relying on MenuProvider for menu handling |\n| **ViewPager to ViewPager2 Migration (Activities)** <br> `BaseListActivity.java`, `ItemActivity.java` | Replaced ViewPager with ViewPager2; integrated TabLayoutMediator for tab synchronization; updated page change callbacks for FAB toggling and lazy loading; added getFragment(position) helper for fragment retrieval by tag |\n| **ItemPagerAdapter Migration** <br> `ItemPagerAdapter.java` | Migrated from FragmentStatePagerAdapter to FragmentStateAdapter; updated constructor to accept FragmentActivity instead of FragmentManager; implemented createFragment(position) and getItemId(position); replaced getCount/getItem with getItemCount/createFragment |\n| **Custom ViewPager Removal** <br> `ViewPager.java` | Deleted deprecated custom ViewPager subclass (onInterceptTouchEvent override and setSwipeEnabled method); now relying on native ViewPager2 |\n| **Layout Updates (ViewPager \u2192 ViewPager2)** <br> `layout-w820dp-land/activity_list.xml`, `layout/activity_item.xml` | Replaced custom `io.github.sheepdestroyer.materialisheep.widget.ViewPager` with `androidx.viewpager2.widget.ViewPager2` in layout declarations |\n\n## Sequence Diagram(s)\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Fragment as BaseFragment\n    participant VC as ViewCreated\n    participant MP as MenuProvider\n    participant Activity as Activity\n    participant Menu as Menu\n\n    Fragment->>VC: onViewCreated(view, bundle)\n    VC->>MP: new MenuProvider()\n    MP->>Activity: addMenuProvider(menuProvider, lifecycle)\n    Note over MP: Menu handling via callbacks\n    MP->>MP: onCreateMenu(menu, inflater)\n    MP->>Fragment: createOptionsMenu(menu, inflater)\n    MP->>Menu: Menu populated\n    Activity->>Menu: Display menu\n    Menu->>MP: onMenuItemSelected()\n    MP->>Fragment: onOptionsItemSelected(item)\n```\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Activity as ItemActivity\n    participant VP2 as ViewPager2\n    participant TLM as TabLayoutMediator\n    participant TabLayout as TabLayout\n    participant Adapter as ItemPagerAdapter\n    participant Fragment as Fragment(Position)\n\n    Activity->>Adapter: new ItemPagerAdapter(activity, builder)\n    Activity->>VP2: setAdapter(adapter)\n    Activity->>VP2: setOffscreenPageLimit(2)\n    Activity->>TLM: new TabLayoutMediator(tabLayout, viewPager2)\n    TLM->>TLM: attach()\n    TLM->>TabLayout: setTitle from adapter\n    Note over TLM: Tabs synced with pages\n    VP2->>Adapter: createFragment(position)\n    Adapter->>Fragment: Create fragment\n    VP2->>Activity: onPageSelected(position)\n    Activity->>Activity: toggleFabs(isComments)\n    Activity->>Fragment: trigger lazy loading\n```\n\n## Estimated code review effort\n\n\ud83c\udfaf 4 (Complex) | \u23f1\ufe0f ~45 minutes\n\n## Possibly related issues\n\n- **sheepdestroyer/materialisheep#52**: This PR directly implements the Fragment API modernization tasks (replacing onActivityCreated with onViewCreated, migrating to MenuProvider, introducing ViewModel for lazy-load state, and transitioning from ViewPager to ViewPager2 with FragmentStateAdapter).\n\n## Possibly related PRs\n\n- **sheepdestroyer/materialisheep#51**: Related to fragment lifecycle changes in BaseFragment; the previous PR adds `@SuppressWarnings(\"deprecation\")` to the same deprecated methods that this PR removes entirely.\n\n## Suggested labels\n\n`modernization`, `fragment-api`, `viewpager2-migration`, `lifecycle-update`\n\n## Poem\n\n> \ud83d\udc30 *Hopping through timelines, old methods fade away,*  \n> *MenuProvider dances where options menus once lay,*  \n> *ViewPager2 springs forth with graceful TabLayout grace,*  \n> *ViewModel remembers where state finds its place,*  \n> *In modern fragments, the rabbit finds delight!* \ud83c\udf89\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end -->\n\n\n<!-- pre_merge_checks_walkthrough_start -->\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udea5 Pre-merge checks | \u2705 2 | \u274c 1</summary>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\u274c Failed checks (1 warning)</summary>\n\n|     Check name     | Status     | Explanation                                                                           | Resolution                                                                         |\n| :----------------: | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Docstring Coverage | \u26a0\ufe0f Warning | Docstring coverage is 21.74% which is insufficient.

    "body": "## Summary of Changes\n\nHello @sheepdestroyer, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request significantly modernizes the application's UI and Fragment management by adopting contemporary AndroidX components and lifecycle practices. The core changes involve upgrading the paging mechanism from the legacy ViewPager to ViewPager2, streamlining Fragment lifecycle callbacks, and introducing ViewModel for robust state retention. These updates enhance maintainability, improve performance, and ensure compatibility with the latest Android development standards.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **ViewPager2 Migration**: The application has been migrated from the deprecated `ViewPager` and `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` to the modern `ViewPager2` and `FragmentStateAdapter` for improved performance and integration with AndroidX.\n* **Fragment Lifecycle Modernization**: Deprecated Fragment lifecycle methods like `onActivityCreated` have been replaced with `onViewCreated` across several fragments (`BaseFragment`, `BaseListFragment`, `FavoriteFragment`, `LazyLoadFragment`, `ListFragment`) to align with current Android development best practices.\n* **State Retention with ViewModel**: The `setRetainInstance` method, which is now deprecated, has been replaced by a new `LazyLoadViewModel` to manage the state of `LazyLoadFragment` instances, ensuring proper data retention across configuration changes.\n* **Modern Menu Handling**: Menu creation and preparation in `BaseFragment` have been updated to use the `androidx.core.view.MenuProvider` API, replacing the older, deprecated Fragment menu callbacks.\n* **Custom ViewPager Removal**: The custom `io.github.sheepdestroyer.materialisheep.widget.ViewPager` class has been removed, as its functionality (swipe enabling) is now handled directly by `ViewPager2`'s `setUserInputEnabled` method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.

This is brittle if the adapter uses stable IDs, if the dataset changes, or if the underlying tag format differs. Validate that fragments are consistently found/removed across rotation/process death, and consider using adapter item IDs or FragmentManager fragment list filtering by container id instead of fixed tags.\n</summary>\n\n```java\n    // Remove fragments by Tag (\"f\" + id).
